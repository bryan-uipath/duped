# duped

Find duplicated functions and types across a codebase: same name, similar shape, or copied body. Supports TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, C# and Rust.

`duped` parses syntax with tree-sitter. It needs no compiler, no language server and no embeddings. Results are evidence for review: read both sides before refactoring.

> Early development. Commands are listed in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) and are not implemented yet.
